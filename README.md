# Classification of Iris and handwritten numbers

This project is two-folded. The first part focuses on designing a linear classifier and evaluating it using the Iris dataset.

The second part creates classifiers that classifies handwritten number using 10.000 images. A NN-classifier, clustering-based classifier
and a KNN-classifier were designed. The classifiers performance and processing time were evaluated. The NN-classifier 
had the best performance. However, the cluster-based classifier had the lowest processing time.

Have a look at the pdf in this repo for a better understanding of this project.
