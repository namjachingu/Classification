# Classification of Iris and handwritten numbers

This rapport focuses only on classification, where two subjects are solved. The first subject designs and evaluates a linear classifier. 
It classififier classifies the different Iris species. 

The second subject creates classifiers that classify handwritten number using 10.000 images. A NN-classifier, clustering-based classifier
and a KNN-classifier were designed. The classifiers performance and processing time were evaluated. The NN-classifier 
had the best performance. However, with regards to processing time, the clustering-based classifier is considered the most optimal choice.
